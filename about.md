Levi did his graduate work at the University of Utah, focusing on atmospheric predictability. There he used ensemble methods to improve numerical models, in terms of both the lead time and estimated intensity of hurricane development. 

At Health Catalyst, Levi started out on the platform engineering team, writing software for the company’s core ETL offering. After moving internally to lead the data science team, Levi founded [healthcare.ai](http://healthcare.ai), the first open-source machine learning project focused on healthcare outcomes. 

He’s now working to integrate healthcare.ai into each of Health Catalyst’s products and make healthcare.ai the international center of collaboration for healthcare machine learning
